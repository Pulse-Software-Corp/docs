title: 'Extraction Library'
description: 'Browse, organize, and revisit all your saved extractions in a searchable, folder-based library.'
---

## Overview

The **Extraction Library** is where all your saved extractions live. Every time you extract a document with `storage: { enabled: true }`, the result is saved to your organization's library. You can browse past extractions, organize them into folders, re-open results, run schema or split on them, and share them with team members.

---

## Accessing the Library

Navigate to **Extractions** in the Playground sidebar to open the library. You'll see:

- **Folders** — organize extractions into named folders
- **Extractions** — individual saved extractions with filename, file type, page count, and creation date
- **Schema count** — number of schema versions applied to each extraction

## Features

### Search and Filter

Use the search bar at the top to find extractions by filename. Results filter in real-time across all folders.

{/* SCREENSHOT: extraction-library-search.png — The search bar filtering extractions */}

### Folders

Organize your extractions into folders for different projects, clients, or document types:

- **Create folders** — click the **New Folder** button
- **Drag and drop** — move extractions between folders by dragging
- **Expand/collapse** — click a folder to see its contents
- **Rename/delete** — right-click or use the menu on each folder

### Pagination

Large libraries are paginated automatically:
- **Folders** load in batches of 10, with a "Load More" button
- **Extractions within folders** load in batches of 50, with pagination controls

### Viewing an Extraction

Click any extraction to open it in the detail view. From there you can:

- **View markdown** — see the full extracted text
- **View tables** — browse detected tables
- **View bounding boxes** — see element locations overlaid on the original document
- **View schema** — see structured output (if schema was applied)
- **Run new schema** — apply a new or modified schema without re-extracting
- **Run split** — divide the extraction into topics
- **Re-extract** — process the document again with different settings
- **Export to Excel** — convert tables to `.xlsx` via [Meridian](/platform-reference/meridian)

### Sharing

Share an extraction with a public link:

- Click the **Share** button on any extraction
- Toggle **public access** on/off
- Set an optional **expiration date**
- Copy the public URL to share with anyone — no API key required

{/* SCREENSHOT: extraction-library-share.png — The share dialog with public access toggle */}

### Bulk Actions

Select multiple extractions using checkboxes for bulk operations:

- **Move to folder** — move selected extractions to a different folder
- **Delete** — remove selected extractions

---

## Schema Versioning

Each extraction can have multiple schema versions. When you apply a new schema (or re-run with a modified one), a new version is created — the previous version is preserved. In the extraction detail view:

- Switch between versions using the **version selector**
- Compare results across different schema configurations
- Roll back to a previous version if needed

See [Reruns](/platform-reference/reruns) for more on iterating with schemas.

## API: Listing Saved Extractions

You can also list and retrieve saved extractions programmatically:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.runpulse.com/api/v1/extractions",
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"},
    params={"folders_limit": 10, "per_folder_limit": 50}
)

data = response.json()

for folder in data["folders_with_extractions"]:
    print(f"Folder: {folder['name']}")
    for extraction in folder["extractions"]:
        print(f"  - {extraction['filename']} ({extraction['page_count']} pages)")
```

---

## Storage Requirement

<Warning>
  Extractions only appear in the library if `storage: { enabled: true }` was passed during extraction. Without storage, the extraction result is returned directly but not saved.
</Warning>

To ensure all extractions are saved, always include:

```python
result = client.extract(
    file=open("document.pdf", "rb"),
    storage={"enabled": True}
)
```

Or in the Playground, storage is enabled by default.
