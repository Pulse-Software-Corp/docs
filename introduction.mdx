## Welcome to Pulse API

Pulse parses and extracts data from complex enterprise documents including PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations, images, and more. The platform is designed for high-quality document understanding rather than traditional OCR, using in-house systems for layout, reading order, tables, charts, handwriting, and complex document structures.

At this scale, Pulse is running inside some of the most demanding production environments in the world, including Fortune 50 technology organizations, top global private equity firms, large insurance carriers, and fast-growing AI-native teams, with over one billion pages processed.
