## File Upload

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="/extract Endpoint"
    icon="cloud-arrow-up"
  >
    Accepts a presigned URL from the user, typically used for high volume page count documents.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="/convert Endpoint"
    icon="cloud-arrow-down"
  >
    Provides a presigned URL from Pulse's secure S3 bucket for extraction of smaller files.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Document Processing

We offer both structured Markdown and JSON responses. JSON outputs can be customized using your own schema via the `/extract` endpoint parameters.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Header Chunking"
    icon="heading"
  >
    Splits content based on document headers and section breaks.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Page Chunking"
    icon="file"

    Divides content by individual pages for page-specific processing.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Semantic Chunking"

    Segments content based on semantic meaning and context.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Recursive Chunking"
    icon="repeat"

  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Table Extraction"
    icon="table"
  >
    Extract tables in matrix format using the `return_tables` parameter. Returns tables as 2D arrays for easy processing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  An intelligent chunking strategy is coming soon! Our model will automatically select the optimal chunking mode for your specific use case.

## Processing Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Submit your document via presigned URL or direct upload
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Our backend models extract content based on your parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response" icon="download">
    Receive your processed output directly or via presigned URL for larger documents
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Large Document Responses

For documents exceeding 70 pages, responses are delivered via secure URLs:

```json
{
  "is_url": true,
  "url": "https://pulse-studio-api.s3.region.amazonaws.com/results/...",
  "plan-info": {
    "pages_used": 0,
    "tier": "foundation"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Response URLs automatically expire after 24 hours for security. Store these URLs securely as they contain your processed results.
</Note>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Direct Response"
    icon="file-lines"
  >
    Documents under 70 pages return results directly in the API response
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="URL Response"
    icon="link"
  >
    Larger documents return a secure, temporary URL to access results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Asynchronous Processing

For processing large documents or handling multiple requests, we provide asynchronous endpoints:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="/extract_async Endpoint"
    icon="clock"
  >
    Initiates asynchronous document processing and returns a job ID for tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="/poll Endpoint"
    icon="magnifying-glass"
  >
    Check the status of an ongoing processing job using the job ID.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="/cancel Endpoint"
    icon="stop"
  >
    Cancel an in-progress processing job if needed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Async processing is recommended for documents larger than 50 pages or when processing multiple files simultaneously.
</Note>

## Batch Processing

<Card
  title="/batch_extract_async Endpoint"
  icon="layer-group"
>
  Process multiple documents in parallel with customized parameters for each file.
</Card>

### Batch Processing Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Multiple Input Sources"
    icon="files"
  >
    Accept both file URLs and file paths in a single batch request
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Custom Schemas"
    icon="code"
  >
    Apply different extraction schemas for each document
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Parallel Processing"
    icon="microchip"
  >
    Process multiple documents simultaneously for improved throughput
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Unified Tracking"
    icon="list-check"
  >
    Monitor all jobs with a single batch ID
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Batch processing automatically handles rate limiting and queuing to ensure optimal performance.
