title: 'Cancel Job'
openapi: 'DELETE /job/{jobId}'
---

## Overview

Cancel an asynchronous job that is currently pending or processing. 

Jobs that have already completed, failed, or been canceled will remain unchanged.

## Response

A successful cancellation returns a confirmation message:

```json
{
  "job_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "message": "Job cancelled successfully"
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `job_id` | string | Identifier of the job that was cancelled. |
| `message` | string | Human-readable confirmation message. |

## When to Cancel Jobs

Cancel jobs when:
- The extraction is no longer needed
- You submitted a job with incorrect parameters
- You want to stop processing to conserve page usage

<Note>
  Cancellation is best-effort. If a job is already mid-processing, it may complete before the cancellation takes effect. Pages used before cancellation are still counted toward your usage.
</Note>

## Example Usage

```bash
# Cancel a pending or processing job
curl -X DELETE https://api.runpulse.com/job/abc123-def456 \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python
import requests

def cancel_job(job_id: str, api_key: str):
    response = requests.delete(
        f"https://api.runpulse.com/job/{job_id}",
        headers={"x-api-key": api_key}
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Job {job_id} cancelled successfully")
    elif response.status_code == 404:
        print(f"Job {job_id} not found")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to cancel: {response.text}")
```
