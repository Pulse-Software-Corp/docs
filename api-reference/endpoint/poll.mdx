title: 'Poll Job'
openapi: 'GET /job/{jobId}'
---

## Overview

Check the status and retrieve results of an asynchronous job (e.g., submitted via `/extract_async`).

Poll this endpoint periodically until the job reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, or `canceled`).

## Response

The response includes job metadata and, when completed, the full extraction results.

```json
{
  "job_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "status": "completed",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:31:45Z",
  "result": {
    "markdown": "# Document Title\n\nExtracted content...",
    "page_count": 15,
    "bounding_boxes": { ... },
    "plan-info": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `job_id` | string | Unique identifier for the extraction job. |
| `status` | string | Current job status: `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, or `canceled`. |
| `created_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp when the job was submitted. |
| `updated_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of the last status update. |
| `result` | object | Extraction output (only present when `status` is `completed`). See [Extract](/api-reference/endpoint/extract) for result structure. |
| `error` | string | Error message (only present when `status` is `failed`). |

### Job Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Job is queued and waiting to be processed. |
| `processing` | Job is currently being processed. |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully. Results are available in the `result` field. |
| `failed` | Job encountered an error. See `error` field for details. |
| `canceled` | Job was canceled before completion. |

## Polling Strategy

We recommend polling with exponential backoff:

```python
import time
import requests

def poll_job(job_id: str, api_key: str, max_attempts: int = 60):
    url = f"https://api.runpulse.com/job/{job_id}"
    headers = {"x-api-key": api_key}
    
    delay = 1  # Start with 1 second
    
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        data = response.json()
        
        if data["status"] == "completed":
            return data["result"]
        elif data["status"] == "failed":
            raise Exception(f"Job failed: {data.get('error')}")
        elif data["status"] == "canceled":
            raise Exception("Job was canceled")
        
        # Still pending or processing - wait and retry
        time.sleep(delay)
        delay = min(delay * 1.5, 10)  # Cap at 10 seconds
    
    raise Exception("Polling timeout")
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Poll for job status
curl https://api.runpulse.com/job/abc123-def456 \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
