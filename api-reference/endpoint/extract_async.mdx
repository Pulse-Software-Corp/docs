## Large Document Response Structure

For documents exceeding 70 pages, the completed job result includes a URL structure:

```json
{
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "job_id": "job-id",
  "result": {
    "is_url": true,
    "url": "https://pulse-studio-api.s3.region.amazonaws.com/results/...",
    "plan-info": {
      "pages_used": 0,
      "tier": "foundation"
    }
  },
  "status": "completed",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
```

### Key Points:
- Documents over 70 pages return a URL containing the complete response
- URLs automatically expire after 24 hours
- No changes required to your API request structure
- For documents under 70 pages, the API continues to return results directly in the `result` field

### Implementation Tips:
1. Check if `result` contains `"is_url": true`
2. If true, fetch the complete document data from the provided URL
3. Store URLs securely as they contain your processed results
