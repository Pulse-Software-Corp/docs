<Note type="warning">
  **Large Document Processing**: For documents over 50 pages, we strongly recommend using the [/extract_async](/api-reference/endpoint/extract_async) endpoint instead. The async endpoint prevents timeout issues and provides better handling of extensive processing tasks.
</Note>

## Large Document Response Structure

For documents exceeding 70 pages, the API returns a URL structure instead of the direct response:

```json
{
  "is_url": true,
  "url": "https://pulse-studio-api.s3.region.amazonaws.com/results/...",
  "plan-info": {
    "pages_used": 0,
    "tier": "foundation"
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
- Documents over 70 pages return a URL containing the complete response
- URLs automatically expire after 24 hours
- No changes required to your API request structure
- For documents under 70 pages, the API continues to return results directly

### Implementation Tips:
1. Check if response contains `"is_url": true`
2. If true, fetch the complete document data from the provided URL
3. Store URLs securely as they contain your processed results
