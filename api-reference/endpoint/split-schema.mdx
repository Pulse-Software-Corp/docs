# Split Schema — Deprecated

<Warning>
  The `/split-schema` endpoint has been merged into the unified [`/schema`](/api-reference/endpoint/schema) endpoint. Use `/schema` with a `split_id` parameter instead.
</Warning>

## Migration

Replace your `/split-schema` calls with `/schema` using `split_id`:

**Before:**
```json
POST /split-schema
{
  "split_id": "uuid",
  "split_schema_config": { ... }
}
```

**After:**
```json
POST /schema
{
  "split_id": "uuid",
  "split_schema_config": { ... }
}
```

The request body is identical — just change the URL from `/split-schema` to `/schema`.

See the [Schema Extraction](/api-reference/endpoint/schema) docs for full details on both single and split modes.
