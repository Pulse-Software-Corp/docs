## Overview

All Pulse API endpoints require authentication using an API key. This key identifies your organization and tracks usage for billing purposes.

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create an account at [runpulse.com/pricing-studio-pulse](https://runpulse.com/pricing-studio-pulse)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Click "Create New Key" and copy the generated key immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once when created. Store them securely - you cannot retrieve them later.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with every request:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://dev.api.runpulse.com/extract \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://dev.api.runpulse.com/extract",
    headers=headers,
    files={"file": open("document.pdf", "rb")}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

fetch('https://dev.api.runpulse.com/extract', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: formData
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - **Never expose API keys in client-side code** - Use server-side proxies
    - **Use environment variables** - Don't hardcode keys in your source code
    - **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new keys periodically
    - **Use separate keys** - Different keys for development, staging, and production
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables:

    ```bash .env
    PULSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    ```python Python
    import os
    
    API_KEY = os.getenv("PULSE_API_KEY")
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const API_KEY = process.env.PULSE_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Key Rotation">
    To rotate your API key:
    
    1. Generate a new key in the Console
    2. Update your application to use the new key
    3. Verify the new key is working
    4. Delete the old key from the Console
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing API Keys

### View Active Keys

Access your API keys at [runpulse.com/pricing-studio-pulse](https://runpulse.com/pricing-studio-pulse):

- See all active keys
- View creation dates
- Monitor usage per key
- Delete compromised keys

### Key Permissions

All API keys have full access to:
- Document extraction endpoints
- File upload endpoints

- Webhook configuration

<Note>
  Fine-grained permissions are coming soon. Contact support if you need restricted access patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AUTH_001: API key is required">
    **Solution**: Ensure you're including the `x-api-key` header in your request
    
    ```bash
    # Incorrect - missing header
    curl -X POST https://api.runpulse.com/extract
    
    # Correct - includes header
    curl -X POST https://dev.api.runpulse.com/extract \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AUTH_002: Invalid API key">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Key was typed incorrectly
    - Key has been deleted
    - Using a key from a different environment
    
    **Solution**: Verify your key in the Console and ensure you're copying it correctly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="BILLING_001: Monthly page limit exceeded">
    **Solution**: 
    - Check your usage in the Console
    - Upgrade your plan for higher limits
    - Contact support for temporary limit increases
  </Accordion>
