## Data Protection Architecture

    ### Storage Security

      <ListItem icon="lock-closed">
        Enterprise-grade encryption across all data states
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem icon="cloud">
        Secure AWS S3 infrastructure with granular permissions
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem icon="clock">

      </ListItem>
      <ListItem icon="shield-check">
        No data retention for Scale+ customers
      </ListItem>
    </List>

    Our storage infrastructure is built on AWS S3 with enterprise-grade security measures. All data is automatically purged after 48 hours, ensuring minimal data retention. We implement strict access controls and encryption at every layer:

    - AES-256 encryption at rest
    - TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
    - Granular bucket policies and IAM roles
    - Regular security audits and monitoring

      </ListItem>
    </List>

    Our AI infrastructure combines self-hosted models and trusted partnerships:

    - Self-hosted OCR and specialized ML models
    - Zero-retention agreements with AI partners
    - Isolated processing environments
    - End-to-end encrypted data pipelines

### Processing Pipeline Security

Our processing pipeline is designed with security at its core:

- **Isolated Environments**: Each processing task runs in isolated containers
- **Self-hosted Components**: Critical OCR and ML models run on our secure infrastructure
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every service-to-service communication is authenticated and encrypted
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and threat detection

### Data Lifecycle Management

We maintain strict control over data throughout its lifecycle:

1. **Ingestion**: Data is encrypted immediately upon upload
2. **Processing**: Processed in isolated, ephemeral containers
3. **Storage**: Temporarily stored in encrypted S3 buckets
4. **Deletion**: Automatic deletion after 48 hours
5. **Verification**: Regular audits ensure deletion compliance

### Access Controls

Our role-based access control (RBAC) system ensures:

- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication
- Regular access reviews
- Detailed audit trails
- Automated access revocation
